# RANDOM FOREST IN FORECASTING RAIN-INDUCED LANDSLIDES
##Abastract
Recent studies in the Philippines on landslides have primarily focused on susceptibility mapping and generation of hazard maps. Whereas, research on landslide forecasting remains less explored. As artificial intelligence continues to progress, forecasting methods have become more advanced, allowing opportunities to predict landslide occurrences before they happen. The study focuses on rainfall, a primary triggering factor of landslides, examining its relationship with environmental variables such as slope, soil type, and soil moisture to predict potential landslide events. The study applies the random forest model to forecast landslides using a minimized yet significant set of predictors (rainfall, slope, soil moisture, slope). One-Way ANOVA was conducted to assess differences in model performance under various combinations of input variables, followed by post hoc tests to determine the most effective predictive variables. The researchers found out that combining rainfall and environmental variables as predictors yielded the highest accuracy at 90%, outperforming models that use only individual variable inputs. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the random forest model in forecasting landslides even with limited resources and data, highlighting its potential as a practical and adaptable tool for early warning systems in mountainous regions of the Philippines.
